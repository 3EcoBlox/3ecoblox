#### Partner Spotlight: Mobi Battery Recycling (South Korea)

The challenge of electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling is a global issue, especially in high-adoption areas like Jeju Island, South Korea. Mobi Battery Recycling (or a similar entity working with Jeju Technopark, based on the search snippets) focuses on the evaluation and reuse of retired EV batteries for second-life applications like Energy Storage Systems (ESS) before final material extraction.
