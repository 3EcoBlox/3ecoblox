      "quote": "I got the typical eye roll when I suggested EcoBlox to Vinny. But creating a battery recycling game transformed our dinner conversations into discussions about lithium waste and sustainability. EcoBlox meets kids where they are—through gaming—and suddenly they're engaged, motivated, and learning real-world problem-solving without realizing it.",

      "quote": "As the youngest on his team, I worried Benjamin might struggle. Instead, EcoBlox brought out leadership qualities I didn't know he had. He learned to voice ideas confidently, developed technical skills in Roblox Studio, and now feels empowered to create games that could change how his friends think about environmental issues.",

      "quote": "As both parent and educator, I'm impressed by how EcoBlox weaves sustainability and design thinking together. Riddhi developed interdisciplinary skills—critical thinking, clear communication, systematic problem-solving—that we discuss in education but rarely see implemented this effectively. This is experiential learning that truly prepares students for real-world challenges.",
